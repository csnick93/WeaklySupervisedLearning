# WeaklySupervisedLearning

This is a small tensorflow based framework intended for playing around with different weakly supervised deep learning algorithms. Given images and class level labels, the algorithms attempt to not only classify the object(s) in the image correctly, but also to localize them. The framework has the following structure:
